## **Portfolio Project**

Portfolio Project

Description
The Portfolio Project is a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and experiences. It serves as a platform to highlight my expertise, provide information about my work, and showcase my accomplishments to potential employers.

The project consists of seven files in the component:

App.js: The main component that renders the entire application and sets up the routing.

Navbar.js: The navigation bar component that displays the logo, menu items, and links to different sections of the portfolio.

HeroSection.js: The hero section component that includes a background image, a title, and a brief introduction about myself.

Skills.js: The skills section component that displays my technical skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, using icons and progress bars.

Projects.js: The projects section component that showcases some of my recent projects, including project names, descriptions, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.

Experience.js: The experience section component that presents my work experience, including job titles, company names, and the duration of each position.

Footer.js: The footer component that appears at the bottom of the page and includes a "Made with Love" message and a heart icon.
